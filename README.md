# MN-COVID-19-Data-Cleaning-and-Analysis
This project uses a dataset obtained from https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/respiratory/stats/hosp.html in order to understand hospitalizations over time within Minnesota from 2020 - 2025. 

## Introduction
This project analyzes data obtained from the Minnesota Department of Health in order to understand continued patterns of hospitalization due to repiratory illness, especially COVID-19 over a five year period from 1/3/2023 - 2/2/2025. This data is valuable because it allows us to cross reference hospitalization patterns with vaccination rates (against the COVID-19 virus), allowing us to draw some preliminary conclusions on the long term effectiveness of the virus.
  This project will seek to analyze a few specific pieces of data. First, I analyze total rates of hospitalization by age group (figure 1). Next, I analyze rates of hospitalization over time for each age group. Finally, I cross reference both total hospitalization per age group and immunization rates in order to see whether there is any change in long-term hospitalization rates based on vaccination status. 

## Background
The COVID-19 pandemic was a significant time period in world history. It saw the development of a number of different vaccination options with unprecedented speed. A study from the [NIH](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7889064/) notes that, > While typical vaccine development can take upwards of 10â€“15 years, COVID-19 vaccines were developed in less than a year after the identification of COVID-19.
